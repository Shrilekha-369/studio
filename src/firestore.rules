/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and bookings,
 * and allows public read access to class schedules and gallery items. Write access to class schedules
 * and gallery items is restricted to admin users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /classSchedules/{classScheduleId}: Stores class schedule information. Publicly readable, write access is restricted to admins.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Accessible by the user themselves or by an admin.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Stores booking information for a specific user. Accessible by the user and admins.
 * - /galleryItems/{galleryItemId}: Stores gallery items (images, descriptions). Publicly readable, write access is restricted to admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Admins can read user profiles to manage bookings.
 * - Class schedules and gallery items are publicly readable.
 * - Write access to class schedules and gallery items is restricted to users with an `admin` custom claim.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Booking` entity includes a `userId` field to directly link bookings to users, enabling
 *   owner-based access control without requiring additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data (profiles and bookings) is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path,
 *   while global data (class schedules and gallery items) is stored in top-level collections.
